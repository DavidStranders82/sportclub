# sportclub

With this application I experimented for the first time with Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap, and i used my knowledge about Java, html/css, Spring, MVC, mySQL which I learned after 6 months of a one year program to become a Java Software Engineer (see more (in Dutch): www.it-omscholing.nl). I built this app in January 2017.

I tried to build a nice looking crud webapplication for a non-existing sportclub. The homepage has an introduction, latest news and upcoming events like games and competitions. As a quest user you can also visit detailpages with memberprofiles, teamprofiles and competitions. 
Members can also login and see more detail information about other members, teams and competitions. They can also edit their own profile.
Admins have their own section where they can create, update and delete members, teams, games and competitions. 

As it is a experimental project, there is much work left to do: 
- Adding much more unit and integration tests
- Refactoring long, inefficient and complex methods
- Rebuilding the front-end with Angular and use RESTful webservices
- etc.

NOTE: if you want to run this project locally (default it uses a preloaded H2database) and want to log in as admin, use these credentials:
